Place the provided PNG file here to use as the site logo:

File name expected by the site: cortx-logo-bluish.png

Path: /public/cortx-logo-bluish.png

Once you copy the PNG into the `public` folder, the site header/footer will automatically use it. If the file is not present, the site will fall back to an inline SVG placeholder logo.

If you'd like, I can add the binary for you — paste the PNG here or tell me where it's located and I will add it.
